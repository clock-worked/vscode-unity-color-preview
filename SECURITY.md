### Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please do not create a public issue. Instead:

- Create a private security advisory in the repository (GitHub → Security → Advisories), or
- Email the maintainer via the contact information in the GitHub profile for `Clockworked`.

We will assess the report as quickly as possible and provide guidance and timelines for a fix.
